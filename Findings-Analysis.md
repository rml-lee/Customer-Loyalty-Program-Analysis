- On average, the highest lifetime value customers are coming from the Eastern Canadian provinces of **Quebec, Newfoundland and Labrador, and New Brunswick**.
  
- Customers with the lowest average lifetime value are primarily located in the western territory of **Yukon**. This is largely due to the territory's unique economic and logistical challenges, including its remote location, high transportation costs, and elevated prices for goods and services. As a result, it tends to have a higher Cost of Living Index compared to many other Canadian provinces.

- **Recommendation**: Consider retailoring marketing strategies towards lower valued customers. Create targeted promotions, region-specific offers, or localized advertising to help extend lifetime value. 

## 4. What impact did the 2018 promotion have on the amount of enrollment compared to previous years?

- The 2018 promotion campaign occurred from February to the end of April. Without the promotion program, we would normally receive around 200 enrollments. 

- The 2018 promotion campaign overall was a success, netting an additional 100 to 150 new customers per month while it was active.

- April was the strongest month during the promotion, which yielded a total of 346 new customers. 

- **Recommendations**: Continue to implement the promotion program annually and explore new creative ways to advertise and market it to attract new customers.


## 11. What was the quarterly Churn Rate during 2018?

- The churn rate overall has been relatively low, hovering around 1% throughout the year of 2018. This indicates that thereâ€™s a high level of customer retention.
  
- The small decline in churn rate during the second quarter is likely due to the amount of new customers obtained during the 2018 promotion.
  
- **Recommendations**: Continue to understand the customer. Continuously gather and analyze customer feedback to understand their needs, preferences, and grievances. Use surveys, focus groups, and social media listening tools. This will help maintain and potentially improve churn rate.
